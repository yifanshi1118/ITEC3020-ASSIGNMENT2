To make this work, I added a button that, when clicked, runs a JavaScript function. This function adds or removes a 'dark-mode' class to the body of the page. The class changes the colors to match the theme. I also used localStorage to remember the user's choice, so the website stays in the chosen theme even after they leave and come back."

Here's how I did it: First, I made a JSON file to store the blog data, like titles and content. Then, I wrote JavaScript code that fetches this data and creates HTML elements for each blog post. This way, the blog page automatically updates whenever I change the JSON file, making it easy to keep the content fresh and organized."
